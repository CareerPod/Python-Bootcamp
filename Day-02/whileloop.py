# Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Number:", count)
    count += 1  # Increment count to avoid infinite loop

# Example: Sum numbers until a condition is met
sum = 0
number = 1
while number <= 5:
    sum += number  # Add the current number to the sum
    number += 1    # Move to the next number
print("Sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is:", sum)
